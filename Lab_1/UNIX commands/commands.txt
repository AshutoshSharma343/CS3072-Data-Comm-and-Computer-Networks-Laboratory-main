1) arp--. the arp command is used to view and manipulate the ARP cache,
which is a table that maps IP addresses to corresponding physical(MAC)addresses on a local network

he output provides information about the mapping between IP addresses and MAC addresses on your local network. Here's a breakdown of the information in the displayed ARP cache:

    Address: This column shows the IP addresses in the ARP cache.

    HWtype: Indicates the hardware type. In your case, it's "ether," meaning Ethernet.

    HWaddress: Displays the MAC (hardware) addresses associated with the corresponding IP addresses.

    Flags: Describes the status or characteristics of the ARP entries. For example, "C" indicates that the entry is complete.

    Mask: Specifies the network mask associated with the entry.

    Iface: Represents the network interface where the ARP entry is located. In your case, it's "eno1."

From the output you provided:

    192.168.42.68: This IP address is associated with the MAC address 00:04:96:8b:af:d3 on the network interface eno1.

    192.168.42.217: This IP address is associated with the MAC address f8:0d:60:b9:61:c9 on the network interface eno1.

    _gateway: This entry represents the default gateway IP address (router) and is associated with the MAC address 00:04:96:98:8f:32 on the network interface eno1.

    169.254.169.254: This entry is marked as "incomplete," indicating that the ARP resolution for this IP address is incomplete on the network interface eno1.

2) ping-->
The ping command is used to test the reachability of a host on a network
 by sending ICMP echo request packets and waiting for corresponding replies. 
 For example: ping www.google.com
