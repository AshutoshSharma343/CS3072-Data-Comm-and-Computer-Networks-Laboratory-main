A bridge is a networking device that operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and is used to connect two or more network segments. Its primary function is to filter and forward data frames between these segments based on the MAC (Media Access Control) addresses of devices

bridges are devices that operate at the data link layer and are used to connect and segment network segments. They help in reducing collision domains, learning and filtering MAC addresses, and facilitating transparent communication between different segments of a network. While bridges played a crucial role in early networking, modern networks often use switches for similar purposes.
